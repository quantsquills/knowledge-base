# July 2021 - Grania Kelly and Gavin Winter

Grania

* a way of seeing the world and visualisging change
* 20-30 years of changing landscape of Qld
* brought together tech, science and maths
* recognising the river as key to Brisbane, the river defines the city
* Grania brought a storytelling background to the project
* using the landscape to tell stories; allowing people to understand their stories by studying the landscape
* at its core, its about connection

Gavin

* how to engage with people
* where their water comes from; how people relate to their waterways
* we don't tend to appreciate our water infrastructure
* we had the gear, we didn't have the narrative
* what could we use to guide the journey, we needed a lens
* haptic - this was the perfect project for it cause it did feel like water
* Couldn't get drone permission at mouth of river, that's why we used St Helena
* how do you have a dialogue to change behaviour

Grania

* you could use for Great Barrier Reef for example, how do you educate people 

Gavin

* we didn't have pressure to make a proint mindful of what it was and what it wasn't

Grania

* Curiocity brief was for fun and curious

Gavin

* this was original canvas
* it's also online as videos but it probably diminishes it slightly
* if you are telling a story about where people have grown up - that is really sticky
* data is hardest thing to sort out

Grania 

* \(to simon comment\) - that's the kind of personal narrative that I wanted ppl to come with
* going to another city - Adelaide - not a river, but it has landscape
* \(what is next?\) getting people to contribute back to the story
* people start feeding their own ground truths - allow people to input data

Gavin

* asking people, how do you feel about this? What is the sentiment?

Grania

* approach councils for community consultation
* people give feedback and you can access data
