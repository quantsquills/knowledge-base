# March - Michael and Jules, natural language generation



*  What is nlg – data -&gt; language
*  Common misunderstanding – it’s not ML or AI. What we’re talking about it is human controlled, ‘whoever creates an nlg script is in total control of the text that comes out”
*  Seek to power alexa/google assistant
*  ABC Emergency – we have a way of outputting data from emergency services – this is visual
*  On a visual platform, you can communicate a lot without words
*  But on a voice platform, you can’t express information visually
*  So we used nlg to solve the issue for voice
*  First prototype example
*  What are other orgs doing – bbc for election coverage, used the one script to create 690 stories when an electorate was called
*  AP do this for 4000 companies each quarter
*  Arria.com/covid19-microsoft/
*  Hyperdrive – stitched together from open sources stuff. Started with Glitch
*  Jules did a demo of how he built this in glitch – has to clean the data first
*  Single sentence in a national story – this vastly reduces the effort/leg work of nlg, but the value is really high
*  Use “if” statements to deal with the data
*  Micro details – how do we make sure postcodes are said properly but house numbers are said a different way
*  Academic stuff on nlg – from Dan
