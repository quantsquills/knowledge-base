| Event Director                | <p>This is the person taking charge of organising this event. They are usually a member of the management committee and are tasked with:</p><ul><li>Organising the speaker(s)</li><li>Ensuring event descriptiopn is added to meetup.com and announced to members</li><li>Arranging volunteers for the other roles</li><li>Fulfilling vital roles for which volunteers could not be found.</li></ul> |
| Venue setup                   | Responsible for setting up the venue, this role usually needs to be fulfilled by an ABC staff member as it requires access to various areas of the building that aren't publicly accessible.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Venue setup assistant         | Assist the person setting up the venue by: putting out chairs, carrying and setting up tables, getting projector and other AV setup, setting up drinks, ensuring toilets are open, etc. The more helpers with this the better. It goes quickly with just one or two additional people lending a hand.                                                                                                |
| Attendee check-off            | Say hello to all attendees and check them off the list of RSVPs. Taking details of anyone who hadn't RSVPd (and encouraging them to do so next time).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Photography                   | Taking photos of the event and uploading photos                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Venue pack up                 | Pack everything up and ensure chairs, tables, etc are returned and venue is left clean and tidy. This usually has to be an ABC employee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Venue pack up assistant       | The more hands the merrier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Tweeting                      | Live tweet the event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Event write up for newsletter | We do an event write up each month in the [newsletter](https://us20.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=b159620fe75ddd72734247f92\&id=298dc804d1). This requires some note taking at the event and some writing after the fact.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Ordering food                 | Make sure the crowd gets fed. This needs to be someone on the management committee just because that's the easiest way to pay for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Catering supplies             | Before the event, ensure that there enough supplies like plates, napkins, cups, etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Getting ice                   | Gab some ice from somewhere on your way to the venue. Preferably be there a bit early to give the drinks a chance to cool down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
